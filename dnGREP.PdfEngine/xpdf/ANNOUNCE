Subject: ANNOUNCE: Xpdf 4.06 - a PDF viewer and related tools

Glyph & Cog, LLC is pleased to announce a new version of Xpdf, the
open source Portable Document Format (PDF) viewer.  The Xpdf project
also includes a PDF text extractor, PDF-to-PostScript converter, and
various other utilities.

Xpdf uses the Qt toolkit and runs on Linux and Windows.  The
non-graphical components (pdftops, pdftotext, etc.) run on Linux,
Unix, Windows, MacOSX, and pretty much any other system with a decent
C++ compiler.

4.06 is primarily a bug fix release.  There are some new features:

* New command line options/features:
  - Added the '-listonly' flag to pdfimages.
  - Added the '-u' option to pdfimages.
  - Added the '-J' option to pdfimages to dump JPEG 2000 images.
  - Modified pdftohtml to generate a nicer index page; add the
    '-noframe' option to generate the previous-style index page.

* New configuration options:
  - Added the 'initialMaximized' xpdfrc setting.
  - Added the 'discardCoveredText' xpdfrc setting.
  - Added the 'preferXFAFieldValues' xpdfrc setting.

* XpdfReader improvements:
  - Added the reverseVideoMode, normalVideoMode, and toggleVideoMode
    commands; added the view -> reverse video menu item.
  - Added a '%t' escape to include the currently selected text in the
    argument to xpdf's 'run' command.
  - Use the XDG config and state file directories on Linux.
  - Added a file:close menu item to Xpdf.

* Misc changes:
  - Changed the default from Level 2 to Level 3 PostScript.
  - Added support to pdftohtml for internal links (i.e., links to
    pages in the same document).

See the `CHANGES' file for a complete list of changes.

Source (C++ and C) is available, and it should be fairly easy to
compile for Linux and Windows.
