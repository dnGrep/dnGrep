NAME
       xpdfrc - configuration file for Xpdf tools (version 4.04)

DESCRIPTION
       All of the Xpdf tools read a single configuration file.

       On Linux/Unix/MacOS: if you have a .xpdfrc file in your home directory,
       it will be read.  Otherwise, a system-wide configuration file  will  be
       read  from  /etc/xpdfrc,  if it exists.  (This is its default location;
       depending on build options, it may be placed elsewhere.)

       On Windows: the file must be named xpdfrc (no leading  dot,  no  exten-
       sion),  and  must  be  placed  in  the same directory as the executable
       (pdftotext.exe, xpdf.exe, etc.)

       The xpdfrc file consists of a series of configuration options, one  per
       line.   Blank  lines  and  lines  starting  with  a  '#' (comments) are
       ignored.

       Arguments can be single-quoted or double-quoted, e.g., for  file  names
       that contain spaces ("aaa bbb", 'aaa bbb').  This quoting does not pro-
       vide any escaping, so there's no way to include a  double  quote  in  a
       double-quoted argument or a single quote in a single-quoted argument.

       Arguments  can  also be at-quoted: @"aaa bbb".  At-quoted strings allow
       use of the DATADIR variable, which is set to the 'data' subdirectory in
       the  xpdf install directory.  The percent sign (%) is an escape charac-
       ter: a percent sign followed by any other character  is  replaced  with
       that character.

              @"abc %"def%" ghi" --> abc "def" ghi
              @"${DATADIR}/foo"  --> ...install-dir.../data/foo
              @"%${DATADIR}/foo" --> ${DATADIR}/foo

       The  following  sections  list all of the configuration options, sorted
       into functional groups.  There is an examples section at the end.

INCLUDE FILES
       include config-file
              Includes the specified config  file.   The  effect  of  this  is
              equivalent  to  inserting  the  contents of config-file directly
              into the parent config file in place  of  the  include  command.
              Config files can be nested arbitrarily deeply.

GENERAL FONT CONFIGURATION
       fontFile PDF-font-name font-file
              Maps  a  PDF font, PDF-font-name, to a font for display or Post-
              Script output.  The  font  file,  font-file,  can  be  any  type
              allowed  in  a  PDF file.  This command can be used for 8-bit or
              16-bit (CID) fonts.

       fontDir dir
              Specifies a search directory for font files.  There can be  mul-
              tiple fontDir commands; all of the specified directories will be
              searched in order.  The font files can be Type 1 (.pfa or  .pfb)
              or TrueType (.ttf or .ttc); other files in the directory will be
              ignored.  The font file name (not including the extension)  must
              exactly  match  the  PDF font name.  This search is performed if
              the font name doesn't match any of the fonts declared  with  the
              fontFile command.  There are no default fontDir directories.

       fontFileCC registry-ordering font-file
              Maps  the  registry-ordering  character collection to a font for
              display or PostScript output.  This mapping is used if the  font
              name  doesn't match any of the fonts declared with the fontFile,
              fontDir, psResidentFont16, or psResidentFontCC commands.

POSTSCRIPT FONT CONFIGURATION
       psFontPassthrough yes | no
              If set to "yes", pass 8-bit font names through to the PostScript
              output  without  substitution.   Fonts which are not embedded in
              the PDF file are expected to be available on the printer.   This
              defaults to "no".

       psResidentFont PDF-font-name PS-font-name
              When the 8-bit font PDF-font-name is used (without embedding) in
              a PDF file,  it  will  be  translated  to  the  PostScript  font
              PS-font-name,  which  is  assumed to be resident in the printer.
              Typically, PDF-font-name and  PS-font-name  are  the  same.   By
              default, only the Base-14 fonts are assumed to be resident.

       psResidentFont16 PDF-font-name wMode PS-font-name encoding
              When the 16-bit (CID) font PDF-font-name with writing mode wMode
              is used (without embedding) in a PDF file, it will be translated
              to the PostScript font PS-font-name, which is assumed to be res-
              ident in the printer.  The writing mode must be either  'H'  for
              horizontal or 'V' for vertical.  The resident font is assumed to
              use the specified encoding (which must have  been  defined  with
              the unicodeMap command).

       psResidentFontCC registry-ordering wMode PS-font-name encoding
              When  a  16-bit (CID) font using the registry-ordering character
              collection and wMode writing mode is used (without embedding) in
              a  PDF  file,  the PostScript font, PS-font-name, is substituted
              for it.  The substituted font is assumed to be resident  in  the
              printer.   The writing mode must be either 'H' for horizontal or
              'V' for vertical.  The resident font is assumed to use the spec-
              ified encoding (which must have been defined with the unicodeMap
              command).

       psEmbedType1Fonts yes | no
              If set to "no", prevents embedding of Type 1 fonts in  generated
              PostScript.  This defaults to "yes".

       psEmbedTrueTypeFonts yes | no
              If  set  to "no", prevents embedding of TrueType fonts in gener-
              ated PostScript.  This defaults to "yes".

       psEmbedCIDTrueTypeFonts yes | no
              If set to "no", prevents embedding of CID TrueType fonts in gen-
              erated PostScript.  For Level 3 PostScript, this generates a CID
              font, for lower levels it generates a  non-CID  composite  font.
              This defaults to "yes".

       psEmbedCIDPostScriptFonts yes | no
              If  set  to  "no", prevents embedding of CID PostScript fonts in
              generated PostScript.  For Level 3 PostScript, this generates  a
              CID  font,  for  lower  levels  it generates a non-CID composite
              font.  This defaults to "yes".

POSTSCRIPT CONTROL
       psPaperSize width(pts) height(pts)
              Sets the paper size for PostScript output.  The width and height
              parameters  give  the paper size in PostScript points (1 point =
              1/72 inch).

       psPaperSize letter | legal | A4 | A3 | match
              Sets the paper size for PostScript output to  a  standard  size.
              The  default  paper size is set when xpdf and pdftops are built,
              typically to "letter" or "A4".  This can also be set to "match",
              which will set the paper size to match the size specified in the
              PDF file.

       psImageableArea llx lly urx ury
              Sets the imageable area for PostScript output.  The  four  inte-
              gers  are the coordinates of the lower-left and upper-right cor-
              ners of the imageable region, specified in points (with the ori-
              gin being the lower-left corner of the paper).  This defaults to
              the full paper size;  the  psPaperSize  option  will  reset  the
              imageable area coordinates.

       psCrop yes | no
              If  set  to  "yes",  PostScript output is cropped to the CropBox
              specified in the PDF file; otherwise no cropping is done.   This
              defaults to "yes".

       psUseCropBoxAsPage yes | no
              If  set  to  "yes",  PostScript output treats the CropBox as the
              page size.  By default, this is "no", and the MediaBox  is  used
              as the page size.

       psExpandSmaller yes | no
              If set to "yes", PDF pages smaller than the PostScript imageable
              area are expanded to fill the  imageable  area.   Otherwise,  no
              scaling is done on smaller pages.  This defaults to "no".

       psShrinkLarger yes | no
              If  set  to  yes, PDF pages larger than the PostScript imageable
              area are shrunk to fit the imageable area.  Otherwise, no  scal-
              ing is done on larger pages.  This defaults to "yes".

       psCenter yes | no
              If  set  to yes, PDF pages smaller than the PostScript imageable
              area (after any scaling) are centered  in  the  imageable  area.
              Otherwise,  they  are  aligned  at  the lower-left corner of the
              imageable area.  This defaults to "yes".

       psDuplex yes | no
              If set to "yes", the generated PostScript will set the  "Duplex"
              pagedevice  entry.  This tells duplex-capable printers to enable
              duplexing.  This defaults to "no".

       psLevel level1 | level1sep | level2 | level2gray | level2sep | level3 |
       level3gray | level3Sep
              Sets  the  PostScript  level  to  generate.   This  defaults  to
              "level2".

       psPreload yes | no
              If set to "yes", PDF forms are converted to PS  procedures,  and
              image  data  is  preloaded.   This uses more memory in the Post-
              Script interpreter, but generates significantly smaller PS files
              in situations where, e.g., the same image is drawn on every page
              of a long document.  This defaults to "no".

       psOPI yes | no
              If set to "yes",  generates  PostScript  OPI  comments  for  all
              images  and  forms  which  have OPI information.  This option is
              only available if the Xpdf tools were compiled with OPI support.
              This defaults to "no".

       psASCIIHex yes | no
              If  set to "yes", the ASCIIHexEncode filter will be used instead
              of ASCII85Encode for binary data.  This defaults to "no".

       psLZW yes | no
              If set to "yes", the LZWEncode filter will be used for  lossless
              compression in PostScript output; if set to "no", the RunLength-
              Encode filter will be used instead.  LZW generates  better  com-
              pression  (smaller  PS  files), but may not be supported by some
              printers.  This defaults to "yes".

       psUncompressPreloadedImages yes | no
              If set to "yes", all preloaded images in PS  files  will  uncom-
              pressed.  If set to "no", the original compressed images will be
              used when possible.  The "yes" setting is useful to work  around
              certain buggy PostScript interpreters.  This defaults to "no".

       psMinLineWidth float
              Set  the  minimum  line width, in points, for PostScript output.
              The default value is 0 (no minimum).

       psRasterResolution float
              Set the resolution (in dpi) for rasterized pages  in  PostScript
              output.   (Pdftops will rasterize pages which use transparency.)
              This defaults to 300.

       psRasterMono yes | no
              If set to "yes", rasterized pages in PS files will be monochrome
              (8-bit gray) instead of color.  This defaults to "no".

       psRasterSliceSize pixels
              When  rasterizing pages, pdftops splits the page into horizontal
              "slices", to limit memory usage.  This option sets  the  maximum
              slice size, in pixels.  This defaults to 20000000 (20 million).

       psAlwaysRasterize yes | no
              If set to "yes", all PostScript output will be rasterized.  This
              defaults to "no".

       psNeverRasterize yes | no
              Pdftops rasterizes an pages that use transparency (because Post-
              Script  doesn't  support  transparency).  If psNeverRasterize is
              set to "yes", rasterization is disabled:  pages  will  never  be
              rasterized, even if they contain transparency.  This will likely
              result in incorrect output for PDF files that use  transparency,
              and  a  warning  message  to  that effect will be printed.  This
              defaults to "no".

       fontDir dir
              See the description above, in the DISPLAY FONTS section.

TEXT CONTROL AND CHARACTER MAPPING
       textEncoding encoding-name
              Sets the encoding to use for text output.  (This can be overrid-
              den  with  the  "-enc"  switch on the command line.)  The encod-
              ing-name must  be  defined  with  the  unicodeMap  command  (see
              above).  This defaults to "Latin1".

       textEOL unix | dos | mac
              Sets  the  end-of-line  convention  to use for text output.  The
              options are:

                  unix = LF
                  dos  = CR+LF
                  mac  = CR

              (This can be overridden with the "-eol" switch  on  the  command
              line.)   The  default  value  is  based on the OS where xpdf and
              pdftotext were built.

       textPageBreaks yes | no
              If set to "yes", text extraction will insert page  breaks  (form
              feed characters) between pages.  This defaults to "yes".

       textKeepTinyChars yes | no
              If  set  to "yes", text extraction will keep all characters.  If
              set to "no", text extraction will discard tiny (smaller  than  3
              point)  characters  after  the  first  50000  per page, avoiding
              extremely slow run times for PDF files that use special fonts to
              do shading or cross-hatching.  This defaults to "yes".

       nameToUnicode map-file
              Specifies  a  file with the mapping from character names to Uni-
              code.  This is used to handle PDF fonts that have  valid  encod-
              ings  but no ToUnicode entry.  Each line of a nameToUnicode file
              looks like this:

                   hex-string name

              The hex-string is the Unicode (UCS-2) character index, and  name
              is  the  corresponding  character  name.  Multiple nameToUnicode
              files can be used; if a character name is given more than  once,
              the  code in the last specified file is used.  There is a built-
              in default nameToUnicode table  with  all  of  Adobe's  standard
              character names.

       cidToUnicode registry-ordering map-file
              Specifies the file with the mapping from character collection to
              Unicode.  Each line of a cidToUnicode file represents one  char-
              acter:

                   hex-string

              The  hex-string is the Unicode (UCS-2) index for that character.
              The first line maps CID 0, the second line  CID  1,  etc.   File
              size  is  determined  by size of the character collection.  Only
              one file is allowed per character collection; the last specified
              file is used.  There are no built-in cidToUnicode mappings.

       unicodeToUnicode font-name-substring map-file
              This  is used to work around PDF fonts which have incorrect Uni-
              code information.  It specifies a file which maps from the given
              (incorrect)  Unicode  indexes  to the correct ones.  The mapping
              will be used for any font  whose  name  contains  font-name-sub-
              string.   Each  line  of  a unicodeToUnicode file represents one
              Unicode character:

                  in-hex out-hex1 out-hex2 ...

              The in-hex field is an input (incorrect) Unicode index, and  the
              rest  of  the  fields  are  one or more output (correct) Unicode
              indexes.  Each occurrence of in-hex will  be  converted  to  the
              specified output sequence.

       unicodeRemapping remap-file
              Remap Unicode characters when doing text extraction.  This spec-
              ifies a file that maps from a particular Unicode index  to  zero
              or  more  replacement  Unicode  indexes.  Each line of the remap
              file represents one Unicode character:

                  in-hex out-hex1 out-hex2 ...

              Any Unicode characters not listed will be left unchanged.   This
              function  is  typically  used  to remap things like non-breaking
              spaces, soft hyphens, ligatures, etc.

       unicodeMap encoding-name map-file
              Specifies the file with mapping from Unicode  to  encoding-name.
              These encodings are used for text output (see below).  Each line
              of a unicodeMap file represents a range of one or  more  Unicode
              characters  which  maps linearly to a range in the output encod-
              ing:

                   in-start-hex in-end-hex out-start-hex

              Entries for single characters can be abbreviated to:

                   in-hex out-hex

              The in-start-hex and in-end-hex fields  (or  the  single  in-hex
              field)  specify  the Unicode range.  The out-start-hex field (or
              the out-hex field) specifies the start of  the  output  encoding
              range.   The  length  of  the  out-start-hex (or out-hex) string
              determines the length of the output characters (e.g., UTF-8 uses
              different  numbers of bytes to represent characters in different
              ranges).  Entries must be given  in  increasing  Unicode  order.
              Only  one  file is allowed per encoding; the last specified file
              is used.  The Latin1, ASCII7, Symbol, ZapfDingbats,  UTF-8,  and
              UCS-2 encodings are predefined.

       cMapDir registry-ordering dir
              Specifies  a  search  directory,  dir,  for  CMaps  for the reg-
              istry-ordering character  collection.   There  can  be  multiple
              directories  for  a particular collection.  There are no default
              CMap directories.

       toUnicodeDir dir
              Specifies a search directory, dir, for ToUnicode  CMaps.   There
              can  be  multiple  ToUnicode  directories.  There are no default
              ToUnicode directories.

       mapNumericCharNames yes | no
              If set to "yes", the Xpdf tools  will  attempt  to  map  various
              numeric character names sometimes used in font subsets.  In some
              cases this leads to usable text, and in other cases it leads  to
              gibberish -- there is no way for Xpdf to tell.  This defaults to
              "yes".

       mapUnknownCharNames yes | no
              If set to "yes", and mapNumericCharNames is  set  to  "no",  the
              Xpdf  tools  will  apply  a simple pass-through mapping (Unicode
              index = character code) for all unrecognized glyph names.   (For
              CID  fonts, setting mapNumericCharNames to "no" is unnecessary.)
              In some cases, this leads to usable text, and in other cases  it
              leads  to  gibberish  -- there is no way for Xpdf to tell.  This
              defaults to "no".

       mapExtTrueTypeFontsViaUnicode yes | no
              When rasterizing text using an external TrueType font, there are
              two  options  for  handling character codes.  If mapExtTrueType-
              FontsViaUnicode is set to "yes", Xpdf will use the  font  encod-
              ing/ToUnicode  info  to map character codes to Unicode, and then
              use the font's Unicode cmap to map Unicode to GIDs.  If  mapExt-
              TrueTypeFontsViaUnicode  is  set  to  "no", Xpdf will assume the
              character codes are GIDs (i.e., use an identity mapping).   This
              defaults to "yes".

       useTrueTypeUnicodeMapping yes | no
              If  set  to  "yes", the Xpdf tools will use the Unicode encoding
              information in TrueType fonts (16-bit  only),  if  avaiable,  to
              override  the PDF ToUnicode maps.  Otherwise, the ToUnicode maps
              are always used when present.  This defaults to "no".

       dropFont font-name
              Drop all text drawn in the specified font.  To drop  text  drawn
              in unnamed fonts, use:

                  dropFont ""

              There can be any number of dropFont commands.

RASTERIZER SETTINGS
       enableFreeType yes | no
              Enables  or  disables  use of FreeType (a TrueType / Type 1 font
              rasterizer).  This is only relevant if the Xpdf tools were built
              with  FreeType  support.   ("enableFreeType"  replaces  the  old
              "freetypeControl" option.)  This option defaults to "yes".

       disableFreeTypeHinting yes | no
              If this is set to "yes", FreeType hinting will  be  forced  off.
              This option defaults to "no".

       antialias yes | no
              Enables  or  disables  font anti-aliasing in the PDF rasterizer.
              This option affects all font rasterizers.  ("antialias" replaces
              the anti-aliasing control provided by the old "t1libControl" and
              "freetypeControl" options.)  This default to "yes".

       vectorAntialias yes | no
              Enables or disables anti-aliasing of vector graphics in the  PDF
              rasterizer.  This defaults to "yes".

       imageMaskAntialias yes | no
              Enables  or disables anti-aliasing of image masks (when downsam-
              pling or upsampling) in the PDF rasterizer.   This  defaults  to
              "yes".

       antialiasPrinting yes | no
              If   this  is  "yes",  bitmaps  sent  to  the  printer  will  be
              antialiased (according to the "antialias" and  "vectorAntialias"
              settings).   If  this  is  "no",  printed  bitmaps  will  not be
              antialiased.  This defaults to "no".

       strokeAdjust yes | no | cad
              Sets the stroke adjustment mode.  If  set  to  "no",  no  stroke
              adjustment will be done.  If set to "yes", normal stroke adjust-
              ment will be done: horizontal and vertical lines will  be  moved
              by  up  to  half  a  pixel to make them look cleaner when vector
              anti-aliasing is enabled.  If set to "cad", a slightly different
              stroke adjustment algorithm will be used to ensure that lines of
              the same original width will always have the same adjusted width
              (at  the  expense of allowing gaps and overlaps between adjacent
              lines).  This defaults to "yes".

       forceAccurateTiling yes | no
              If this is set to "yes", the TilingType is forced to 2 (no  dis-
              tortion)  for  all tiling patterns, regardless of the setting in
              the pattern dictionary.  This defaults to "no".

       screenType dispersed | clustered | stochasticClustered
              Sets the halftone screen type, which will be used when  generat-
              ing  a  monochrome  (1-bit)  bitmap.  The three options are dis-
              persed-dot dithering, clustered-dot dithering (with a round  dot
              and   45-degree  screen  angle),  and  stochastic  clustered-dot
              dithering.  By default, "stochasticClustered" is used for  reso-
              lutions of 300 dpi and higher, and "dispersed" is used for reso-
              lutions lower then 300 dpi.

       screenSize integer
              Sets the size of the (square) halftone screen threshold  matrix.
              By  default, this is 4 for dispersed-dot dithering, 10 for clus-
              tered-dot  dithering,  and  100  for  stochastic   clustered-dot
              dithering.

       screenDotRadius integer
              Sets  the  halftone  screen  dot radius.  This is only used when
              screenType is set to stochasticClustered, and it defaults to  2.
              In  clustered-dot  mode,  the  dot  radius is half of the screen
              size.  Dispersed-dot dithering doesn't have a dot radius.

       screenGamma float
              Sets the halftone screen gamma correction parameter.  Gamma val-
              ues  greater  than 1 make the output brighter; gamma values less
              than 1 make it darker.  The default value is 1.

       screenBlackThreshold float
              When halftoning, all values below this threshold are  forced  to
              solid black.  This parameter is a floating point value between 0
              (black) and 1 (white).  The default value is 0.

       screenWhiteThreshold float
              When halftoning, all values above this threshold are  forced  to
              solid white.  This parameter is a floating point value between 0
              (black) and 1 (white).  The default value is 1.

       minLineWidth float
              Set the minimum line width, in device pixels.  This affects  the
              rasterizer  only,  not  the PostScript converter (except when it
              uses rasterization to handle transparency).  The  default  value
              is 0 (no minimum).

       enablePathSimplification yes | no
              If  set  to  "yes",  simplify  paths by removing points where it
              won't make a significant difference to the shape.   The  default
              value is "no".

       overprintPreview yes | no
              If set to "yes", generate overprint preview output, honoring the
              OP/op/OPM settings in the PDF file.  Ignored for  non-CMYK  out-
              put.  The default value is "no".

VIEWER SETTINGS
       These settings only apply to the Xpdf GUI PDF viewer.

       initialZoom percentage | page | width
              Sets  the  initial  zoom factor.  A number specifies a zoom per-
              centage, where 100 means 72 dpi.  You may also  specify  'page',
              to  fit the page to the window size, or 'width', to fit the page
              width to the window width.

       defaultFitZoom percentage
              If xpdf is started with fit-page or fit-width zoom and no window
              geometry,  it  will calculate a desired window size based on the
              PDF page size and this defaultFitZoom value.  I.e.,  the  window
              size  will  be chosen such that exactly one page will fit in the
              window at this zoom factor (which must be  a  percentage).   The
              default value is based on the screen resolution.

       initialDisplayMode single | continuous | sideBySideSingle | sideBySide-
       Continuous | horizontalContinuous
              Sets the initial display mode.  The default setting is "continu-
              ous".

       initialToolbarState yes | no
              If set to "yes", xpdf opens with the toolbar visible.  If set to
              "no", xpdf opens with the toolbar hidden.  The default is "yes".

       initialSidebarState yes | no
              If set to "yes", xpdf opens with  the  sidebar  (tabs,  outline,
              etc.)   visible.   If  set  to "no", xpdf opens with the sidebar
              collapsed.  The default is "yes".

       initialSidebarWidth width
              Sets the initial sidebar width, in pixels.  This is  only  rele-
              vant  if  initialSidebarState  is  "yes".   The default value is
              zero, which tells xpdf to use an internal default size.

       initialSelectMode block | linear
              Sets the initial selection mode.  The default setting  is  "lin-
              ear".

       paperColor color
              Set the "paper color", i.e., the background of the page display.
              The color can be #RRGGBB (hexadecimal) or a named  color.   This
              option  will  not  work  well with PDF files that do things like
              filling in white behind the text.

       matteColor color
              Set the matte color, i.e., the color used for background outside
              the actual page area.  The color can be #RRGGBB (hexadecimal) or
              a named color.

       fullScreenMatteColor color
              Set the matte color for full-screen  mode.   The  color  can  be
              #RRGGBB (hexadecimal) or a named color.

       selectionColor color
              Set the selection color.  The color can be #RRGGBB (hexadecimal)
              or a named color.

       reverseVideoInvertImages yes | no
              If set to "no", xpdf's reverse-video mode inverts text and  vec-
              tor  graphic  content,  but  not  images.  If set to "yes", xpdf
              inverts images as well.  The default is "no".

       popupMenuCmd title command ...
              Add a command to the popup menu.  Title is the text to  be  dis-
              played  in  the  menu.  Command is an Xpdf command (see the COM-
              MANDS section of the xpdf(1) man page  for  details).   Multiple
              commands are separated by whitespace.

       maxTileWidth pixels
              Set the maximum width of tiles to be used by xpdf when rasteriz-
              ing pages.  This defaults to 1500.

       maxTileHeight pixels
              Set the maximum height of tiles to be used by xpdf when  raster-
              izing pages.  This defaults to 1500.

       tileCacheSize tiles
              Set  the  maximum number of tiles to be cached by xpdf when ras-
              terizing pages.  This defaults to 10.

       workerThreads numThreads
              Set the number of worker threads to be used by xpdf when raster-
              izing pages.  This defaults to 1.

       launchCommand command
              Sets  the  command  executed  when  you click on a "launch"-type
              link.  The intent is for the  command  to  be  a  program/script
              which  determines the file type and runs the appropriate viewer.
              The command line will consist of the file to be  launched,  fol-
              lowed  by  any  parameters  specified with the link.  Do not use
              "%s" in "command".  By default, this is  unset,  and  Xpdf  will
              simply try to execute the file (after prompting the user).

       movieCommand command
              Sets  the command executed when you click on a movie annotation.
              The string "%s" will be replaced with the movie file name.  This
              has no default value.

       defaultPrinter printer
              Sets the default printer used in the viewer's print dialog.

       bind modifiers-key context command ...
              Add  a  key  or  mouse button binding.  Modifiers can be zero or
              more of:

                  shift-
                  ctrl-
                  alt-

              Key can be a regular ASCII character, or any one of:

                  space
                  tab
                  return
                  enter
                  backspace
                  esc
                  insert
                  delete
                  home
                  end
                  pgup
                  pgdn
                  left / right / up / down                (arrow keys)
                  f1 .. f35                               (function keys)
                  mousePress1 .. mousePress7              (mouse buttons)
                  mouseRelease1 .. mouseRelease7          (mouse buttons)
                  mouseClick1 .. mouseClick7              (mouse buttons)
                  mouseDoubleClick1 .. mouseDoubleClick7  (mouse buttons)
                  mouseTripleClick1 .. mouseTripleClick7  (mouse buttons)

              Context is either "any" or a comma-separated combination of:

                  fullScreen / window       (full screen mode on/off)
                  continuous / singlePage   (continuous mode on/off)
                  overLink / offLink        (mouse over link or not)
                  scrLockOn / scrLockOff    (scroll lock on/off)

              The context string can include only one  of  each  pair  in  the
              above list.

              Command  is  an  Xpdf  command  (see the COMMANDS section of the
              xpdf(1) man page for details).  Multiple commands are  separated
              by whitespace.

              The  bind  command replaces any existing binding, but only if it
              was defined for the exact same modifiers, key, and context.  All
              tokens (modifiers, key, context, commands) are case-sensitive.

              Example key bindings:

                  # bind ctrl-a in any context to the nextPage
                  # command
                  bind ctrl-a any nextPage

                  # bind uppercase B, when in continuous mode
                  # with scroll lock on, to the reload command
                  # followed by the prevPage command
                  bind B continuous,scrLockOn reload prevPage

              See the xpdf(1) man page for more examples.

       unbind modifiers-key context
              Removes  a  key binding established with the bind command.  This
              is most useful to remove default key bindings before  establish-
              ing  new  ones  (e.g.,  if  the default key binding is given for
              "any" context, and you want to create new key bindings for  mul-
              tiple contexts).

       tabStateFile path
              Sets the file used by the loadTabState and saveTabState commands
              (see the xpdf(1) man page for more information).

MISCELLANEOUS SETTINGS
       drawAnnotations yes | no
              If set to "no", annotations will not be drawn or  printed.   The
              default value is "yes".

       drawFormFields yes | no
              If  set  to "no", form fields will not be drawn or printed.  The
              default value is "yes".

       enableXFA yes | no
              If an XFA form is present, and this option is set to "yes", Xpdf
              will parse the XFA form and use certain XFA information to over-
              ride AcroForm information.  If set to "no", the  XFA  form  will
              not be read.  The default value is "yes".

       savePageNumbers yes | no
              If  set to "yes", xpdf will save the current page numbers of all
              open files in ~/.xpdf.pages when the files are closed  (or  when
              quitting  xpdf).   Next time the file is opened, the last-viewed
              page number will be restored.  The default value is "yes".

       printCommands yes | no
              If set to "yes", drawing commands are printed  as  they're  exe-
              cuted (useful for debugging).  This defaults to "no".

       printStatusInfo
              If  set to "yes", print a status message (to stdout) before each
              page is processed.  This defaults to "no".

       errQuiet yes | no
              If set to "yes", this suppresses all error and warning  messages
              from all of the Xpdf tools.  This defaults to "no".
