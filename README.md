This program will not transfer any information to other networked systems unless specifically requested by the user or the person installing or operating it. 

The program periodically checks for new versions at github.com, but does not transmit any user information. The version check may be disabled by the user in the dnGrep options.

### Code Signing Policy
This program uses free code signing provided by [SignPath.io](https://signpath.io?utm_source=foundation&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=dngrep), and a certificate by the [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org?utm_source=foundation&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=dngrep).
